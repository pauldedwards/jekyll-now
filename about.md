__Digital transformation for finance, media and sport organisations__

I specialise in the delivering large-scale digital transformation programmes in the media, financial, broadcasting and sport sectors.

I have helped a variety of organisations improve their delivery of digital products including:

  * Pret a Manger
  * Inditex
  * Channel 4
  * BT Sport
  * ITV
  * Amex
  * SpringerNature
  * Siemens Healthcare
  * Telegraph Media Group

I am currently working as a Product Delivery Consultant at [Equal Experts](http://www.equalexperts.com) where I specialise in  supporting companies through digital and organisational transformation, continuous product delivery, leading teams and agile coaching.

My career started at the financial technology start-up [Complinet](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/complinet) as employee number 3 in 1998. I led the development of many of Complinet's B2B online products aimed at Compliance and Regulatory officers in financial services. 

I moved to the leading digital agency [AKQA](http://www.akqa.com) in 2006 to manage the delivery of projects for clients such as Dell, Sainsbury's and ITV. I left AKQA to join the publishing house Hachette Filipacchi to provide expertise in building a digital team to consolidate the digital platforms and develop innovative products for their suite of titles including Elle, Red and Psychologies.

In 2008 I joined [Channel 4](http://www.channel4.com/paralympics) where I ran the successful digital strategy for the London 2012 Paralympics coverage. I was fortunate enough to be part of the team that won BAFTA and BIMA awards for digital innovation for our coverage of the event.

After Channel 4, I moved to [BT Sport](http://http://www.btsport.com) where I led the development of BT Sportsâ€™ digital products for the launch of the broadcast channels in 2013, including the successful mobile app which was downloaded by 3 million customers in its first season. 

Having successfully launched BT Sport I spent some time consulting at the Telegraph Media Group and various sporting organisations before moving to Equal Experts.
