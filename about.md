__Digital transformation for finance, media and sport organisations__

I specialise in the delivering large-scale digital transformation programmes for media companies, financial organisations, broadcasters and sport organisations.

Companies I have helped improve their delivery of digital products include:

*Channel 4
*BT Sport
*ITV
*Amex
*SpringerNature
*Siemens Healthcare
*Telegraph Media Group

I am currently working as a Delivery Consultant at [Equal Experts](http://www.equalexperts.com) supporting companies in their delivery of digital products through consultancy, leading teams and coaching.

My career started at financial start-up [Complinet](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/complinet) as employee number 3 in 1998. I led the development of many of Complinet's B2B online products including recruitment and know-your-customer platforms before leaving to join AKQA in 2006.

I moved to [AKQA](http://www.akqa.com)</a> to manage the delivery of projects for clients such as Dell, Sainsbury's and ITV. I left AKQA to join the publishing house Hachette Filipacchi to provide expertise in building a digital team to consolidate the digital platforms and develop innovative products.

In 2008 I joined [Channel 4](http://www.channel4.com/paralympics) where I ran the successful digital strategy for the London 2012 Paralympics coverage. I was fortunate enough to be part of the team that won BAFTA and BIMA awards for digital innovation for our coverage of the event.

After Channel 4, I joined [BT Sport](http://http://www.btsport.com) where I led the development of BT Sportsâ€™ digital products including the successful mobile app which was downloaded by 3 million customers in its first season.
