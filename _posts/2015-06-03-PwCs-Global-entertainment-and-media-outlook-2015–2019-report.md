PwC have just released <a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/global-entertainment-media-outlook/">their report</a> into the changing face of media and there are some interesting trends, especially where it focusses on the key challenges facing digital sport broadcasters.

The insights that are most interesting for broadcasters are:

"Consumers see no distinction between digital and non-digital" - people don't care where they get the content they want as long as they get it in a reliable, high-quality format that is convenient to them. Too often we superimpose industry divisions on this by referring to TVs as "first-screen" and everything else as "second-screen".

"Broadcast TV advertising’s share of global total TV advertising down from 97.2 per cent in 2014 to 94.3 per cent in 2019" - on the surface this is a small decrease but more money flowing to non-broadcast will mean a greater investment in new advertising methods. 

"Mobile Internet advertising will surge at a 23.1 per cent CAGR to 2019, overtaking display Internet advertising globally in 2018,  and supplanting paid search in the US in 2016 as the leading Internet advertising category." - Successful businesses will integrate advertising into their mobile offerings in a way that feels to the consumer and advertiser like a fair exchange of value. At the moment pre-rolls on live video and any other advertising method that disrupts the live viewing experience breaks this relationship.

The report lays out 3 ways that digital media businesses can be successful in the next 4 years:

"first, innovate around the product and the user experience;" - Product development is only successful when you put the customer's needs first. Speak to your customers and find out the thing that prevents them loving your product and fix it.

"second, develop seamless consumer relationships across distribution channels;" - Whether someone watches live sport on mobile or on TV or on a games console, the relationship they have with your brand should be the same.

"and third, put mobile (and increasingly video) at the centre," - The world is going mobile. During London 2012 there was a 60-40 split in favour of desktop access to the Channel 4 Paralympics website, by the launch of BT Sport in 2013 this had flipped in favour of mobile and that trend is only increasing as younger consumers look to access the content they want, in the way they want.
