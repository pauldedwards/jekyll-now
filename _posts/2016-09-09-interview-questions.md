I have been on the end of some awful interviews in my time. Often the recruiting manager has barely looked at my CV or more worryingly doesn’t seem to really understand the role that they are recruiting for. These are the questions I would like to be asked in an interview as I believe they touch on the aspects that I feel are truly important in enjoying and being good at one’s job.

__What is the biggest change you have made to the way you work in the last 5 years?__

I am fortunate to have worked in an industry where the pace of change seems to increase on a monthly basis. Sometimes this can be exhausting but most of the time this is exhilarating. I am constantly looking at ways to change and enjoy working with people who are better than me at aspects of my job or who do things in a different way as it allows me to become better at what I do.

__Describe a time when your emotions or your understanding of another person’s emotions affected a decision and what was the outcome?__

A few years ago I worked on a very stressful project and my mantra to myself was “drop the emotion”. I was surrounded by people who were confrontational and emotional and my active response to this was to try and ignore the emotion. Since that project I have learned some great colleagues that the best way is to use empathy to try and understand the other person and why their behaviour is the way it is.

__If you were to take this role what would you want to write in your CV in 3 years time that describes what you had achieved?__

When I look back at the projects I have enjoyed most it is not necessarily the high profile roles at Channel 4 or BT Sport but the ones where I was able to work with a great team on something truly innovative.

__What is the most important contribution you have made to a team you were a part of?__

I may have to ask my colleagues this question...

UPDATE: I came across this interesting article from [Slack](https://slackhq.com/three-unconventional-interview-questions-664cc55501e#.crxe0nhd1) which contains some other interesting interview questions
