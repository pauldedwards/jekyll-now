title: Why some projects struggle to deliver value

In the last few years some organisations have begun to move away from a "Project Mindset". They have started to move towards understanding the needs of their users and delivering products which represent actual value.

Others have struggled to identify and quantify this value. Without this knowledge they start to replace their existing tools or processes with “better” code or software but without looking at the underlying human workflows and business processes that underpin them.

Take an example of a business that sells media advertising. Their platform was old and had been built over time to manage the entire lifecycle from forecasting to the delivery and measurement. The client replaced the underlying software which provided some benefits in reliability, modern supported code, some more monitoring and measurement, but they missed out on the opportunity to look at the underlying business processes and to understand why the processes existed in the first place. 

When we analysed the business processes we realised that many of them were only there *because* of constraints put in place by the existing software. By simply replacing the software they were also replacing these constraints.

We began to change the delivery by forming a group that included users as well as the IT team that maintained the platform. We isolated a small part of the platform and began to understand the outcomes required by the different users. This allowed us to identify where there were extra steps or where some tasks could be streamlined. One challenge was to stop people referring back to the existing system but to get them to focus on the jobs that needed to be done and the desired outcomes. 

Once we had a decent understanding of the platform we were able to present back a systems agnostic view of how the workflow could be improved. This identified a number of areas where some teams had different tools for doing the same task or where communication between teams wasn’t optimised. We could then start work on the build.

The approach for the build involved delivering small amounts of working code to production which could then be used by the end users and feedback taken quickly. This allowed us to quantify our assumptions about the customer value.

The overall benefits of this approach were:

Faster delivery of working code into production

Leaner business processes

A greater understanding of the underlying tasks

A more flexible code-base

A more resilient platform through the use of tests, monitoring and cloud based tools
