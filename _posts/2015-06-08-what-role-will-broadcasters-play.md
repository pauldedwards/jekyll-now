These are interesting times for broadcasters. In the last few weeks the NFL has announced a deal with Yahoo! to broadcast a regular season game exclusively online for the first time and on the day of the Champions League Final in Berlin, Facebook broadcast a live show from the fan park. Facebook has provided some more statistics from the event: 

* The stream was viewed 464,310 times
* The average duration of a stream was 17 minutes
* Of the top 10 countries where people viewed the stream, only 3 were European

The above figures will be of interest to the rights owners UEFA as well as broadcasters. It is hard to imagine any broadcasters who have the sort of global reach that would be able to generate the sort of viewing figures that Facebook could. How worried should the broadcasters be?

In the past broadcasters owned the technology required to film a live event and in many cases they owned the only distribution platform that could reach millions of viewers. Technology is now creating a shift. In the last few years we have a seen a move in the ownership of rights from traditional broadcasters to Telcos like Sky and BT. These companies have invested huge amount of money into the broadcast rights for sports when arguably the audience is shifting away from the traditional models of content delivery.

We have seen over the last few years that viewing habits are changing, with an increasing number of people watching live sport on devices other than their living room televisions. The traditional choice of watching sport at home or in the pub has been replaced by the ability to watch live anywhere as long as you have a device capable of streaming and a good enough connection.

The broadcasters have invested in mobile apps for streaming but the investment is still way behind the sort of money that goes into the traditional linear broadcast platforms. If the growth in mobile viewing continues, there will be a tipping point at which Facebook, Youtube etc will be able to offer a very compelling option for the rights holders. They have a much bigger global reach than most broadcasters, and the ability to reach the all-important 16-35 demographic. 

Maybe at this point the entire model of selling sports rights will change to give users complete choice over what they want to watch and how.
