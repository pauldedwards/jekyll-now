I have worked on a number of projects where the team I was a part of was tasked with working in a way that was different to the majority of our colleagues. These have been the most challenging but rewarding projects that I have been involved in and there are many case studies and views on the internet of how these projects can be successful. From all of these projects I have found one consistent behaviour which points to a successful outcome and whose absence nearly always means that the hoped for outcome will end in failure.

There are many problems with the adoption of agile into the mainstream. Primarily there is a misunderstanding that adoption of agile tools and some of the processes are enough and I have heard of companies talking about when they “became fully agile” which is a nonsensical phrase. What these organisations and teams have missed is the understanding of why they want to introduce agile methods. What are the problems they need to solve?

I often start an engagement with an organisation with the following straw man:

Improve the success of the organisation through delivering business value to the customer

and ask the teams I am working with to challenge and adapt that phrase through various exercises to understand what the true vision is.

This should lead to a shared understanding of vision and hopefully it will contain the most important behaviour that I have recognised in teams, the shared belief in asking the question “how do I make this better?”.
 
Teams that share this behaviour ultimately succeed in the face of common phrases such as “That’s just the way this organisation works” or “It has always worked that way we put up with it” as they challenge and look to improve the way things are done.

When teams aren’t empowered to ask the question the organisation will invariably fall back to the status-quo.
