It struck me the other day that I am rapidly approaching the 20 year mark in my career, and the one topic that has occurred more than any other is the difficulty of selecting a content management system that works for clients and customers. 

When I first started work back in 1998 the only real option for publishing your content to the web in an efficient way was to build a bespoke CMS. Our particular flavour was PHP with a MySQL back-end and a bit of PERL thrown in for good measure. There are plenty more options these days but the industry still doesn’t seem any closer to being able to provide a solution that caters for all. I have worked on a number of CMS implementations, both in-house and for clients and have come up with some thoughts on selecting the right solution.

**Your readers aren’t your only customers**

I have seen far too many organisations buy an off-the-shelf CMS because the technology arm of the business has decided that it meets their requirements while ignoring the needs of the people who will use it on a daily basis. Ask the people who put the content into the platform every day what are the important things to them and value their requirements as much as you would others.

**Understand your needs**

Don’t manipulate your needs to fit a solution. It should be the other way around. Work out what types of content you are going to be publishing? how frequently? to what platforms? Understand what the important goals are for your organisation as you will need to compromise. What is more important to you, handling large numbers of users or speed of publishing? High-resolution, large images or fast loading pages? Multimedia content embedded in articles or the ability to publish to many platforms?

**Trial, test, warranty**

If you have decided on one of the larger enterprise solutions, ask them for a period where you can trial the platform. Organise some time where your editorial team can actually use it, possibly colocated at the vendors offices with support available. Let them test drive the functionality they will use. Get a lightweight front-end built, simple homepage and article and go from there. Two weeks spent with a prototype will save pain later on.

**If you are going to build, build small**

A homepage, a page for displaying copy and images and the ability to publish this. That’s it. Start from there and see what you need to change and iterate. Don’t assume you need the full functionality of an enterprise CMS because you probably won’t. From experience you will use 10% of what they offer and get frustrated that the other 90% doesn’t contain the useful stuff you need.

**The web is only part of the solution**

Too many CMS solution publish content straight into HTML. Increasingly the web is only one destination for content. Google, RSS, Apple News and others require a proprietary mark-up that is complex to create from HTML, particularly if the HTML also contains embeds and javascript. Much easier to publish to a format like Markdown and then transform your content to the various markups that you need to deliver to. This is a more future-proof approach as well.

Every organisations needs are different. It tends to be that the publishers who are able to move quickly and adapt to the needs of a rapidly changing publishing environment are those that have built their CMS in-house (Buzzfeed, Medium, The Guardian) and maintain the ability to develop the product in line with the needs of the business.
