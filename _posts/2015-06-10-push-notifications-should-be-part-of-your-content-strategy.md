Media organisations will have a content strategy that covers what they publish on their website, social media platforms and apps. This strategy will allow them to plan and track their copy, video and other content they produce and track it's performance against targets. Few will yet have included push notifications (PNs) in this strategy but increasingly PNs will become a vital part of any media or sporting organisations content mix.

A quick overview: Push notifications were introduced by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/notifications/">Apple</a> in iOS 3 back in 2009. They allow an app to send a custom message to a device even when the app is closed. Recently this functionality has become available as part of OSX on Macs and in Android. Publishers normally send PNs through a service such as <a href="http://urbanairship.com/products/mobile-app-engagement">Urban Airship</a> although there are others.

PNs have had a bad reputation as they were misused by some early mobile games companies and the ability to manage them was not very user friendly. Because of this many people switched off PNs on their smartphones.  However, as wearables and beacons become an integral part of an organisations digital strategy we'll find that PNs are going to be the primary communication between a customer and the brand. The user need here is key, consumers will need to see the benefit of this type of messaging such as allowing them to be passively notified of important events. 

For sports organisations who live in a world where the transfer of information to the fan or customer is very time sensitive and live, PNs will become an increasingly important way of engaging with those fans.

I'm hoping the next evolution of PNs will focus on reducing the friction of user engagement by enabling easier management of the PNs. For publishers, there also need to be better analytical tools that fit with the organisations current analytics platfom.
