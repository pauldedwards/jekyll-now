For a number of years I’ve been interested in building [self-organised teams] as part of my role. I believe breaking away from old hierarchical, command and control processes as a key driver of being able to develop software in an effective way. I’ve seen both methods of running teams and building teams that can problem solve and adapt to changes without the instruction from senior figures delivers much more effective outcomes. The book [“Turn the ship around”] is a great introduction to handing responsibility and control over to teams

I still find that some people reject this approach providing the reasons that their teams are not capable due to lack of appropriate skills, experience or even just the character of the people in those teams. I agree it can be hard to get some people to work in this way if they have always been told what to do next and how to do it but persistence and empathetic coaching ultimately pays off.

Recently I completed a coaching course with the Football Association and was pleased to see that sport is moving in this direction by moving away from old-school autocratic coaching to facilitating self-learning. I have started to use the techniques I use at work with the group of U7 footballers than I am coaching and I find it a similar approach to how I build teams at work.

With the U7s we have tried the following approach:

Asking the players what they want to achieve (i.e. score more goals) and then get them to think about how they are going to achieve that in the next training session (i.e. look to find space)
During the session we stop for drinks breaks and ask them how they felt it went, what they could do better when we restart.

At the end we play matches and then get the players together to review how it went, did they feel like they understood how the training focus worked in the matches, what do they think they should improve next time.

We also get the players to discuss amongst themselves what formation they want to play and who should play where, who should take free-kicks, corners etc. There are very few occasions when we as coaches are dictating what they should be doing, instead we question, provide advice, alternative options but ultimately the players are in charge of their own development.

The results are players who can make decisions as things change and are not looking to the touchline for the coaches to tell them what to do.

It’s been interesting to see similar approaches work in two different scenarios. Seeing the improvements that can be made by working in this way with 6 year old footballers gives me even more confidence that it’s the right way to build professional software development teams.
