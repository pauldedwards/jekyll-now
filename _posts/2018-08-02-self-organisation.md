## A New Post

Recently joined a client where there existed a culture of hierarchy. Teams were unable to make decisions without getting approval from layers of authorisation. Decisions were delayed when people were unavailable. A Technical approach was followed despite the person who designed it having left the organisation weeks ago.

Benefits of this approach

People are more motivated if they feel involved

Blockers

Leadership not willing to give up control
Lack of trust - esp contractors, offshore
Teams that aren't user focussed but dependent on one or two "product specialists"

How to introduce it in an organisation

Start at the team level
Coaching
  Some people not comfortable
  Some voices too loud
  Clear goals
