It’s been a year since I last worked with sporting organisations. In that time I’ve worked on projects at a lot of companies with different levels of digital maturity and it’s given me the opportunity to compare them to sporting orgs.

On a recent train journey I decided to give myself the mental exercise of defining the perfect digital sport organisation. In the last 5 years the adoption of new technologies and increased fan expectations have led clubs and organisations to adopt digital product strategies with differing levels of success. 

What are the characteristics of a good digital sporting organisation?

__They have a single, universal view of their fans__

As the number of potential interactions between fans and clubs increases so does the complexity of the relationship. 50 years ago football fans would have watched their teams from the terraces, maybe watched a match or highlights on TV and read about them in the newspapers. Now fans follow their teams on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and can play as their teams in games like FIFA and Football Manager.

All of these touchpoints create data through which teams can understand their fans better.
