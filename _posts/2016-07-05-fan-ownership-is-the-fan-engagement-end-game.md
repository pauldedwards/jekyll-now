The football team I have supported since I was a child, Wimbledon, celebrated their victory in the League 2 play-off final at the weekend. Their story has always been one of a relatively small but engaged fan-base. It got me thinking about whether the end-state of fan engagement is ultimately fan ownership.

__The Green Bay Packers__

The Milwaukee based NFL team is the only one that is owned by the fans. As of 2015 there were 360,760 shareholders.

How do the shareholders benefit? They can’t make money from their shareholding, there is no special season ticket privilege and no one individual can buy enough shares to take ownership of the club.

The shareholders themselves speak of “community” and knowing that, unlike other NFL franchises, their team will always be there in Green Bay.

__Bundesliga__

The rules of the NFL and other US sports prohibit fan ownership. Green Bay are unique in this aspect. In Germany, however, the opposite rule applies and teams cannot be majority owned by a single individual, instead 51% of a club must be owned by club members.

Many argue that the existence of subsidised ticketing (German games are among the cheapest to attend in Europe), terracing and access to free football on TV can be directly attributed to supporter’s influence in the club’s decision making.

__AFC Wimbledon and Swansea__

In the UK, fan ownership has usually been a response to teams falling financial trouble or a protest against the takeover of a club by various oligarchs, media magnates or cod fishing billionaires.

AFC Wimbledon was created after the previous incarnation of the club was dissolved and their position in the league taken up by the new club MK Dons. The club had been in decline for a number of years since their relegation from the Premier League and mismanagement by their two previous owners.

The benefits of being a member of the Dons Trust are similar to those mentioned by Packers fans or Bundesliga members. They talk of community and a closer relationship to their club.

__Chelsea and Man Utd - missing a trick?__

As more and more sporting teams look to expand their reach and look to new ways of engaging with their long-standing and potential fans, I am surprised that more clubs and teams don’t offer a partial ownership model. Where this does exist in the form of shares i.e. Man Utd, Chelsea, Tottenham etc it is not linked to a sense of closer engagement.
