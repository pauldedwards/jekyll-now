## Innovation challenges

I've been asked to include "innovation" in a roadmap that I'm putting together for a client. It will be presented to the board and needs to feel exciting.

I have a difficult relationship with the term. In a previous company they invited me to an innovation day with senior people. As excited as I was to attend I had spent months in this large, traditional business feeling frustrated at the lack of appetite for trying new ways of working or taking risks. I had assumed that the day would involve the group getting to an understanding of the customer and how we could provide new ways to solve their problems. Instead I spent the day talking to a beauty parade of large enterprise software vendors and had to select 3 that I would be willing to include in my product roadmap. During the entire day the customer wasn't mentioned more than twice.

I left that organisation a few months later frustrated and annoyed.

Later I worked for a small consultancy where I wrote reports on the latest innovations that would impact the industry. I spent a long time researching Bluetooth beacons, RFID, VR, AR, Big Data, drones, IoT and other technologies that have also become buzz words. All of these technologies have strong foundations and have some very smart and capable people working on them. The area that I find is repeatedly missing is the ability to match these technologies with a viable customer need. Too often the use of these technologies are simple PR with no thought to the actual benefits they can bring a customer. Some of the large tech firms are very good at balancing the creation of innovative ideas that have real benefits for people with the need to create good PR.

How do we make sure that innovation can happen and be of benefit to our customers? We need to understand the problems they are having. Sometimes it comes from a "moon-shot" and these tend to grab the headlines but most innovation comes from understanding their needs and having the agility in ways of working to be able to deliver something that solves their problem in a new way.
