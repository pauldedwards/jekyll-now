The broadcasting of sporting events is going through the most disruptive period of change in its history. For many years the industry has barely changed. The proliferation of digital platforms and social networks has created a situation that many broadcasters are finding difficult to navigate.

Many broadcasters have invested in digital but often digital has been seen as ‘different’ and kept at arms length from the ‘real business’ of television rather than being fully integrated into all aspects of the production. As more and more people have chosen to follow sporting events on different devices and through new platforms the traditional TV broadcasters have failed to react effectively. Often this has been down to a lack of understanding or a lack of voices with the right knowledge and experience. On a number of occasions people I have worked with have told me that while some people may choose to watch sport on their smartphone when it comes to big events or Saturday afternoon football matches people will always come back to watching the game on their big TV in the corner of the lounge.

The experience of NBC from the Rio Olympics has shown that this assumption is no longer the case. Behaviours are changing. More people are seeking out sport news on Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter etc. More people are now watching sport on digital devices. This increase has been a pattern since the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and while there are now fewer technical challenges to bringing this content to wherever the fan is the biggest challenge is that the business models are not in place to replace the revenue that will lost from fewer viewers of the traditional tv channels.

TV advertising still makes more money per ad/view than digital although this will have to change as viewers move to different platforms. The TV advertising model is very robust but these models will have to become more flexible and more complex as the broadcast environment fragments with different platforms and different usage patterns.

The slight irony in people bemoaning NBC’s performance at the Rio Olympics and some wondering if they will continue to be the main broadcasting stakeholder in future is that they are one of the few companies on the broadcasting side who have the size to influence these necessary changes.

It will be fascinating to see what happens over the next Olympic cycle. The easy bet is that the consumption of sport events will continue to fragment away from the traditional broadcasters the harder challenge is whether the business models will develop that can evolve to replace the revenue. If they don’t then don’t be surprised to see the 2028 Olympics being broadcast directly by the IOC on whatever social network replaces Facebook and Twitter.
