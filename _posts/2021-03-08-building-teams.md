Recently I’ve stolen a lot of ideas from agile ways of working and applied them to my role as a junior football coach. I initially approached being an unqualified and volunteer coach by doing what I do when outside of my comfort zone, I sought out as many experts in the field as I could find and read and listened to what they had to say. I found that there are surprising similarities between the principles of forming an effective software development team and getting a group of under 9s organised as a sports team.

When first given the task of turning a bunch of football-mad kids into a coherent, mixed-ability team I thought back to the characteristics of the best teams I’ve worked with on software delivery projects. The key attributes those teams displayed were self-organisation, skills mastery, friendship, trust and a shared understanding of the goals.
 
I learnt from reading the thoughts of experienced coaches that a lot of modern sports coaching follows similar principles. The days of a coach screaming instructions from the sideline are mostly gone. There is an emphasis on developing young players who can think for themselves and make decisions during a game. This is similar to having self-organised software delivery teams where we expect teams to be able to adapt to changing situations and respond to feedback.
 
I started asking the football team to organise certain aspects of training and then come back to me and explain why they had made the choices they had. They would describe their decisions carefully. I was pleasantly surprised that these were based on their teammates’ strengths, not on their own preferences (i.e. everyone wanting to be a striker). I followed up by asking them to decide before a match who would take the responsibility for corners, freekicks and penalties. I went into this process thinking it would cause arguments but instead, I got to see a group of 8-year-olds organise themselves into a fairly cohesive unit. They came up with great solutions that included the strengths of everyone in the team. I thought if 8-year-olds can do it….
 
**Chaos into structure**
 
Common in both sports like football and software development is the desire to create order on top of something that by its nature is chaotic. Many of football’s modern principles aim to provide a structure for teams to understand how to operate within a match. They set out the patterns that a team will follow in certain game situations. 

In software development, we have all the various models of managing delivery from waterfall Prince 2 through Scrum, Lean, SAFe etc. At their most basic interpretation, these are all models that attempt to place a layer of structure on top of the non-linear nature of building a software product.

__“it is a way of thinking and understanding the game of football in its logical structure considering its chaotic and complex nature”__

The aim for both teams should be to create an environment and provide the tools for them to react to changing situations but still be able to deliver the desired outcome. In football, we came across a team that had a very rigid drill for starting each match. It was clear that the coaches had spent a lot of time getting the kids to learn and repeat a very specific move that led to them scoring within 3 passes from the kick-off. I'm pleased to say that the players on my team were able to learn what this other team were doing. The next time they tried it we were able to intercept the move and score a goal of our own. In the end, we ran out comfortable winners.

By giving the players such a rigid structure the coaches of the other team could almost guarantee they would score at least one goal but they were unable to adapt once our team had worked out their move. My team regularly make mistakes and try things that don't work but I hope have been given the structure and feedback to learn from these.

Managing a team of 8 year olds is really no different to managing a team of software developers. The key principles are the same:
 
*Successful teams trust each other and have fun
 
*There is freedom to make mistakes and learn without blame
 
*Teams are self-organised with the freedom to make key decisions not top-down command and control
 
*Strong teams over “rock-star” individuals
 
*Focus on building a strong team fits with building products over projects
