Delivering software products is a complex process. Companies may start with a clear objective or idea of what they want to build but the journey to get there is marked by a series of decisions, trade-offs, problems and ambiguity. Humans are very bad at dealing with this level of chaos. Companies try and impose structure through models, maps or frameworks. It’s still common to see a plan for the creation of a software product laid out in a straight line in the form of a Gantt Chart with a clear route from the start to the end of the project. The assumption being that every feature, problem, constraint, risk and solution is clearly understood and that to build the end product we simply have to write the code in the order that it’s been laid out.

The more complex the problem the greater the temptation to do more planning. It's an emotional response to a need to create a structure where there is ambiguity. Companies focus on a more and more granular analysis of problems that may be 3-6 months away. The reaction is to be surprised when the problem requires a different solution to the one that was imagined 3-6 months earlier. The reality is that the situation changes and companies need to be able to adapt. I’ve seen companies double down on their decisions even when the evidence is they need to change course. The plan had set them on a course and they were unwilling or unable to adapt. The plan now owns them.

One of the most effective teams I have ever worked with didn't work off of a plan. There was a list of priorities, but this would change based on new information coming from the business or from feedback. Features were released iteratively as working code onto a production environment where they could be used by real users. Feedback would then be gathered and the team would adapt and change course based on what they had learnt. The plan at the beginning of each phase of work would be in the form of a mind map. This would show the relationship between items but wouldn't define the order that they would be built.

It's important to point out that the team were not working blind. There was a clear business objective, a North Star, that was shared and understood by everyone on the team however the team had the skills, experience and autonomy to decide on the best way of getting there.

Conclusion

Have a plan. You need to know the business outcome you are aiming for but you also need to empower your teams to be able to adapt to changing circumstances and new information that comes from iterative learning.
