Delivering software products is a complex process. Teams may start with a clear objective or idea of what they want to build but the journey to get there is marked by a series of decisions, trade-offs, problems and ambiguity. Humans are very bad at dealing with this level of chaos. Teams try and impose structure through models, maps or frameworks. It's still common to see a plan for the creation of a software product laid out in a straight line in the form of a Gantt Chart with a clear route from the start to the end of the project. The assumption being that every feature, problem, constraint, risk and solution is clearly understood and that to build the end product we simply have to write the code in the order that it's been laid out.

The more complex the problem, the greater the temptation to do more planning. It's an emotional response to create a structure where there is ambiguity. Teams focus on a more and more granular analysis of problems that may be 3-6 months away. The reaction I have seen repeatedly is to struggle when the problem requires a different solution to the one that was imagined 3-6 months earlier. The team is not set-up or the ways of working wonâ€™t allow the team to change direction easily. The reality is that the situation changes and teams need to be able to adapt. I've seen teams double down on their decisions even when the evidence is clear that they need to change course. The plan had set them on a course and they were unwilling or unable to adapt even when continuing on the same path is going to cost more and lead to a worse outcome. The plan now owns them.

The most effective teams I have worked with didn't work off of a traditional plan. There was a list of priorities set by the Product Owner which would change based on new information from the business or feedback from people using the product. Features were released iteratively as working code onto a production environment. Here they could be used by real users. Feedback would then be gathered and the team would adapt and change course based on what they had learnt. This feedback loop was the key driver to be able to test hypotheses and assumptions that had been formed early in the product's lifecycle.

I've known teams to use techniques such as mind maps at the beginning of each new sprint to show the work needed to be done. This would show the relationship between items but wouldn't define the order that they would be built. The team would then discuss the various items and work out the best way to design, build and test each item and importantly how to measure the success. Many software teams release features or products with no idea of how they are going to measure whether it does what it's supposed to do. The ability to measure and react to new information is a key indicator of a highly performing software delivery team.

It's important to point out that these teams were not working blind. They would be working to a clear business objective, a North Star based on user needs that were shared and understood by everyone on the team. Success came from the fact the teams had the skills, experience and had been given the autonomy by the business to decide on the best way of getting to the agreed outcome. This doesn't mean you shouldn't have a plan. You need a team with the skills and behaviours to be confident working in this manner but if you focus on the business outcomes you are aiming for and empower your teams to be able to adapt to changing circumstances then this way of working can be very successful. In my experience putting together a team of experienced, collaborative people, giving them a set of clear goals and then doing whatever the business needs to do to enable them to be successful will always lead to better results than trying to constrain teams with a rigid plan.
