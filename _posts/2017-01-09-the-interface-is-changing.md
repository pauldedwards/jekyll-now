The news coming out of the CES show in Las Vegas last week confirms a pattern that has been emerging since the launch of the iPhone 10 years ago. Where people go to interact with services on the internet is changing and increasingly Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook are the companies battling it out for the new World order.

I’m not that old (really I’m not!) but I can remember a time when the only places to go for news on my football team, for example, was on TV, in the newspapers or on the radio and even then I had to wait for a particular programme to get that news.

This has been followed by the growth of the web and then mobile primarily via adoption of smartphones. If you don’t have an app you are missing a large proportion of people accessing content via mobile [Mobile is eating the world — Benedict Evans](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/12/8/mobile-is-eating-the-world) .  Organisations with content* to publish have adapted to this change at very different speeds. Many traditional media businesses were slow to adapt and have been outmanoeuvred by smaller, more nimble ‘digital first’ companies.

Now things are changing again. Voice interfaces are now arriving in people’s homes. Right now Amazon Alexa feels like the first time I saw an iPad. The potential is obvious but doesn’t have the killer applications that will make it a mainstream success.

This will create new user behaviours and opportunities just like the emergence of the smartphone. Currently the sport options in Alexa are quite poor but there is the ability to add skills. This should be on the roadmap for all sporting organisations in the next 6 months.

This change won’t be without it’s challenges, it’s hard to see where 3rd party monetisation fits into the Alexa world but if recent history is anything to go by, people should be preparing themselves to get on these new interfaces sooner rather than later.

*I hate this term but will think of something to replace it
