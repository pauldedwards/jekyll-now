__The challenge?__
It is hard to overestimate the change that has affected all organisations over the last 10 years and the [prospects for change](https://medium.com/@cdixon/what-s-next-in-computing-e54b870b80cc#.ft2oqeq3l) that companies are facing. Most organisations now understand the importance of digital platforms to their business, whether it is through communications channels, sales opportunities or organisational efficiencies but while many organisations have invested over the last few years in websites or apps many are finding that they are struggling to adapt as the speed of change increases.

As this image from Blackrock shows the speed of adoption of new technologies is increasing rapidly. original source [Vox.com](http://www.vox.com/2016/3/4/11161758/electric-cars-oil-crisis)

Organisations are having to confront:

+ Increase in the number of different platforms and devices that people use
+ The development of the Internet of Things
+ Increase in the number of customers using digital platforms
+ Changes in customer behaviour and their expectations

All of these are potential opportunities for organisations but for those that struggle to adapt they become problems as they will be unable to meet their customers expectations and inevitably the customer will look elsewhere for the service. We have already seen these changes effect companies like Blockbuster, Blackberry, Nokia and Kodak. Meanwhile the likes of [Netflix](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/27/netflix-culture-deck-success_n_6763716.html “Netflix”) and [Spotify]([https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/ “Spotify”) are now seen as examples of how to model 21st century organisations.

The platforms and infrastructure that organisations have invested in are in many instances holding them back from innovation and adaptation.

__What is Digital Transformation__

The term Digital Transformation encapsulates the modern practices adopted by Netflix, Spotify etc that consists of adopting agile and lean methodologies for planning and managing work and technical practices such as continuous integration and micro-services.

More importantly there needs to be a change in the way leadership behaves and looks at new technologies. Industries such as publishing and broadcasting have seen these changes as a threat rather than an opportunity. The leaders within these organisations need to understand that a transformation like this is not a one-off investment, it is a fundamental change in the traditional investment thinking where companies would have long-term relationships with large IT vendors and changing the technology every 2-3 years was seen as frequent.

For some organisations this change is painful, it often means breaking some organisational structure and handing ownership of the solution over to the people who are developing the products. Traditional command and control models do not work in this fast paced environment. Instead a customer-focused environment is required where teams are in control of the products they develop and the tools they use to develop them.

This will often mean moving to a technology strategy that consists of:

+ Open source technology
+ Cloud hosting
+ [Microservices architecture](https://opensource.com/resources/what-are-microservices “Microservices")
+ [Continuous delivery and integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration “Continuous delivery and integration")

These individual models are too much for this blog post but I’ll be sure to come back to these in a future post. In the meantime there are some links to good descriptions of each one.

It has been demonstrated by many organisations that if these practices are adopted then the speed of delivering business value to the end user can be improved and the organisation will be better equipped to adapt to change.

__Conclusion__

Sporting organisations are caught in a perfect storm. They are neither technology organisations and their relationships with large [IT consultancies](http://www.cio.com/article/3040853/software/4-principles-that-will-shape-the-future-of-it.html) are often restrictive.

Adopting these practices can be hard as it requires a change of mindset throughout the organisation. Change is easier for start-ups as they can use these practices from the start but larger organisations will need to work hard to push change throughout the organisation. However, the benefits will far outweigh the costs as they will be able to make the most of opportunities that arise.
